# TwitchMode
Use hotkeys to vote for Vermintide 2 Twitch Mode!

When you open the program for the first time it creates a config.json file.
You must fill in the channel you want to send your votes in, the username of the account you want to post as and the oauth token for the user account.

You can post to any chat you have the privilege to post regular messages.

Twitch doesn't allow direct password logins through their Twitch IRC API, so you'll need to use the oauth token to login (it's a replacement for your password for Twitch chat. Keep it safe as you would keep your password!).

You can generate your oauth token, for example, in here https://twitchapps.com/tmi/
